# Tweet Emotion Classification Project

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project applies supervised learning to classify tweets into six emotions using TF-IDF features and classic machine learning models. By transitioning from Naive Bayes to Logistic Regression, the model's accuracy improved from 84% to 90%, offering a scalable solution for multi-class emotion detection.

## 🎯 Objective
My goal with this project was to create a reproducible NLP workflow that combines text preprocessing, feature scaling, and model tuning to improve classification performance on short-form user-generated text.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Tools & Techniques
* Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
* TF-IDF Vectorization
* MaxAbsScaler
* Multinomial Naive Bayes (initial model)
* Logistic Regression (optimized model)
* Classification Report for precision, recall, F1-score

## 📈 Performance Summary
* **Naive Bayes**: Baseline model (accuracy = 84%)
* **Logistic Regression**: Optimized model (accuracy = 90%)
